interpolate_SMOS_for_MB.m: The DGG of SMOS does not align as accurately with the center of MB site as it does with MA and BERMS, therefore the TB from three closest DGG is interpolated to obtain a match with the site.

compare_SMOS_to_SMAP_and_save.m: Compare SMOS and SMAP TB over MA, MB, and BERMS.

look_SMAP_or_SMOS_TB_data_w_TempNet.m: Analyze the correspondence of SMAP and SMOS derived reflectivity with the in situ soil moisture from the temporary network (TempNet).
